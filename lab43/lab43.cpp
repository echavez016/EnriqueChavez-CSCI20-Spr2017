4.3 Arrays of Objects

Problem Statement
This program mimics an online shopping cart.  
You are the proprieter of an online shop and have to keep track of inventory, price and the userâ€™s shopping cart. 
Create a class to hold the object name, price, and current inventory.  
Output all of the object names for your user to choose what they want.  
As the user purchases an item, you should remove that item from inventory (subtract 1) and add the price to a total. 
When the user is done adding items to their cart, you should output a statement of what they have ordered and the total cost of their purchases.  
Do not allow you inventory to go below 0.

Requirements
Classes with constructor, mutators and accessors, input/output in the main.
